# Contributing to Mallard

Welcome to the Mallard project! We are exciting that you are interested in contributing. We are going to guide you on how to contribute to the project.

## Contributions

Your contributions could be any improvement. Anything that improves the engine.
It is recommended to navigate to ISSUES and UPCOMING FEATURES.
Those include the issues that we are having and the upcoming features that we are not capable of adding yet.

## Edit the code

In the project's repository page, click on "Fork" to create a copy of the project under your GitHub account.
Copy the repository URL from your forked repository and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
cd project-name
```
Always make changes in a separate branch:
```git checkout -b your-branch-name```
Use a descriptive name like "fix-typo", "add-feature", or "update-docs".
Commit your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Insert your description"
```
Go to your forked repository on GitHub. You will see a "Compare & Pull request" button. Click it and:
- Write a clear PR title and description
- Reference related issues (e.g. Closes #12)
- Explain what you changed and why
